# Data Validation in Excel
###### Harry Bauman

<!-- Talk about what it is -->
The data validation tool in Excel allows the creator of a spreadsheet to specify restrictions on the data entered in particular cells. You may set the data validation setting to:
- Any value
- Whole number
- Decimal
- List
- Date
- Time
- Text length
- Custom (a custom rule that you write)

For certain Allow types, it makes sense to specify what range of data is permitted. For all options except list and custom, you may select a data range related to minimum and maximum values. You have the option of selecting a range of:
- between
- not between
- equal to
- not equal to
- greater than
- less than
- greater than or equal to
- less than or equal to
